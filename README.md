# COD-DeathQuotes-Effect /// [Workshop Add-on](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841834816)
A GMod addon that replicated Classic Call of Duty's death screen quote messages.

This addon replicates the death screen in Classic Call Of Duty games with war quotes from the past, future and present, from historic wars thousands of centuries ago to the modern wars from Cold War to Afghan War. Even includes some memey quotes, and some informational quotes.

This also features the death sounds from all COD's.

_I don't take full credit as The Last Of Us Death screen inspired me to make a Call Of Duty death quotes screen, with some help of that addon, this addon is here. You should also take a look at that addon, linked in the credits section._
